<h2> How does a acoustic guitar work? </h2>

<p> The acoustic guitar has two parts, the neck and the body. The strings from the top of the guitar onto the bridge and ends on the saddle.
The acoustic guitar has 6 tuning knobs in total 3 on each side of the guitar. Each of these knobs tunes a certain string and when these knobs are twisted the sound produced from the strings change. 
Now the acoustic guitar makes its sound by letting the vibrations of each stroke resonate in the air in the guitar. This sound then escapes through the sound hole in the guitar which ours ears then pickup.

<h2> How does a electric guitar work? </h2>

<p> The electric guitar is different from the acoustic guitar in how it produces its sound. Some electric guitars have hollow bodies and some have semi hollow bodies similar to the body of an acoustic guitar.
Most electric guitars have a solid body meaning it is not hollow at all. If the body is not hollow then how is the sound produced. An electric guitar has an amplifier which makes the sound, the amplifier picks up vibrations
form a pickup which is a metal rob underneath all 6 strings of the guitar. The amp boosts the sound produced by the guitar making it audible. 
The electric guitar also has a longer neck than the acoustic guitar and also has all 6 tuning knobs/pegs on one side of the guitar head. Most electric solid body guitars come with a Whammy bar.
The whammy bars job is to change the pich of the guitar when pressed on and when released.

<h2> Importance of pick size while playing different melodies. </h2>

<p> There are many kinds of picks that are used by guitarists, they come in different shapes and sizes. Most people dont think that this matters and that if the guitar does not sound ight it is something with the guitar 
or with an amplifier but it can also be the picks that have to be switched. Picks come in different sizes and serve different purposes. A thin pick is used mostly by acoustic guitarists who want a smooth
and defined rythm. They range from .40 mm to .60 mm. The medium pick is the most commonly used pick (I use medium picks most of the time) its stiffness helps with the lead and is also flexiable enough for good rythm.
They range from .60mm to .80mm. Heavy guitar picks provide good control and are very good for people who play lead guitar in a group. The pick size goes from .80mm to 1.2mm. Finally extra heavy picks are any
pick with a thickness of over 1.2mm. These types of picks are mainly used by lead electic guitarists because they make mellower tones and have a widened dynamic range. Size of the pick also matters
as shapes are used to produce different sounds and are better for different types of music genres. Some picks also have textures engroved improving the grip for people who have sweaty fingers or just have bad grip.
